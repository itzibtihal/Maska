## SPRING FRAMEWORK

This application is a basic User Management System
built using Spring Core without Spring Boot,
Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA. It allows users to perform CRUD operations
such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting users through a web interface.

### Dependency Injection (DI)
Dependency Injection is the main functionality provided by Spring IOC(Inversion of Control). The Spring-Core module is responsible for injecting dependencies through either Constructor or Setter methods. The design principle of Inversion of Control emphasizes keeping the Java classes independent of each other and the container frees them from object creation and maintenance. These classes, managed by Spring, must adhere to the standard definition of Java-Bean. Dependency Injection in Spring also ensures loose coupling between the classes. There are two types of Spring Dependency Injection.

1 - Setter Dependency Injection (SDI)

2 - Constructor Dependency Injection (CDI)

### Inversion of Control (IoC)

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle used in software development that reverses the flow of control in a program. 
In Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application. It gets the information about the objects from a configuration file(XML) or Java Code or Java Annotations and Java POJO class. These objects are called Beans. Since the Controlling of Java objects and their lifecycle is not done by the developers, hence the name Inversion Of Control. The followings are some of the main features of Spring IoC,

* Creating Object for us,

* Managing our objects,

* Helping our application to be configurable,

* Managing dependencies, 

### Spring Beans
Hereâ€™s a definition of beans in the Spring Framework documentation:

In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of my application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container.


### Bean Scopes
A Spring Bean Scope defines the lifecycle and visibility of a bean in a Spring container. When a bean is defined, it acts as a recipe for creating instances of a class, and you can control how many instances are created and how they behave. Spring provides six different scopes, four of which are specific to web-aware applications. You can also create custom scopes to manage how beans are instantiated and utilized. Scopes allow developers to configure the lifespan and accessibility of beans, without embedding this logic at the Java class level.

### ApplicationContext

ApplicationContext is a central interface in the Spring Framework that provides configuration information to the application. It extends the BeanFactory interface, adding more advanced featuresuch as:

* Bean lifecycle management and dependency injection.
* Support for enterprise services like transactions, AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), and event propagation.
* Internationalization (i18n) support for message resources.
* Access to various kinds of resources, such as URLs or files.
* Integration with web applications through specialized contexts (like WebApplicationContext).



  **There are several types of configuration in Spring:**



* XML Configuration: Beans are defined in an external XML file, such as applicationContext.xml.
* Annotation-based Configuration: Uses annotations like @Component, @Autowired, and @Service directly in the Java code to manage beans and dependencies.
* Java-based Configuration: Beans are configured using Java classes annotated with @Configuration and @Bean, offering more flexibility.
* Mixed Configuration: Combines XML, annotations, and Java-based approaches as needed in a single application.



### Component Scanning and Stereotype Annotations
 **Component Scanning** is a feature provided by Spring that automatically detects and registers beans in the application context. It eliminates the need to define beans explicitly in the Spring configuration file, making the application more maintainable and scalable. Component scanning is enabled by adding the `<context:component-scan>` element to the Spring configuration file, which specifies the base package(s) to scan for components.
 
 **Stereotype Annotations**
 in Spring are special annotations that indicate the role of a class within the application context
 Such as :
* ***@Component***: Indicates that a class is a Spring-managed component.
* ***@Repository***: Indicates that a class is a Spring-managed repository, typically used for database access.
* ***@Service***: Indicates that a class is a Spring
* ***@Controller***: Indicates that a class is a Spring-managed controller in a Spring MVC application.
* ***@Configuration***: Indicates that a class is a Spring configuration class that defines beans and their dependencies.
* ***@Bean***: Indicates that a method in a configuration class returns a bean to be managed by the Spring container.
* ***@Autowired***: Indicates that a dependency should be automatically injected by Spring.
* ***...***: There are many other stereotype annotations available in Spring, each serving a specific purpose in the application context.

### Spring Data JPA
Spring Data JPA is a part of the Spring Framework that simplifies data access by providing a set of interfaces and methods to interact with databases using the Java Persistence API (JPA), allowing developers to perform CRUD operations with minimal boilerplate code

### Spring MVC
Spring MVC is a part of the Spring Framework that simplifies the development of web applications by providing a Model-View-Controller architecture. It allows developers to create web applications using a variety of view technologies, such as JSP, Thymeleaf, and FreeMarker, and provides support for handling web requests, form submissions, and data binding.
